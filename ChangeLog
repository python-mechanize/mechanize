This isn't really in proper GNU ChangeLog format, it just happens to
look that way.

2010-05-16 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.2.1 release.
	* API change: Change argument order of
	  HTTPRedirectHandler.redirect_request() to match urllib2.
	* Fix failure to use bundled BeautifulSoup for forms. (GH-15)
	* Fix default cookie path where request path has query containing
	  / character. (http://bugs.python.org/issue3704)
	* Fix failure to raise on click for nonexistent label. (GH-16)
	* Documentation fixes.

2010-04-22 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.2.0 release.
	* Behaviour change: merged upstream urllib2 change (allegedly a
	  "bug fix") to return a response for all 2** HTTP responses (e.g.
	  206 Partial Content).  Previously, only 200 caused a response
	  object to be returned.  All other HTTP response codes resulted
	  in a response object being raised as an exception.
	* Behaviour change: Use of mechanize classes with `urllib2` (and
	  vice-versa) is no longer supported.  However, existing classes
	  implementing the urllib2 Handler interface are likely to work
	  unchanged with mechanize.  Removed RequestUpgradeProcessor,
	  ResponseUpgradeProcessor, SeekableProcessor.
	* ClientForm has been merged into mechanize.  This means that
	  mechanize has no dependencies other than Python itself.  The
	  ClientForm API is still available -- to switch from ClientForm to
	  mechanize, just s/ClientForm/mechanize in your source code, and
	  ensure any use of the module logging logger named "ClientForm" is
	  updated to use the new logger name "mechanize.forms".  I probably
	  won't do further standalone releases of ClientForm.
	* Stop monkey-patching Python stdlib.
	* Merge fixes from urllib2 trunk
	* Close file objects on .read() failure in .retrieve()
	* Fix a python 2.4 bug due to buggy urllib.splithost
	* Fix Python 2.4 syntax error in _firefox3cookiejar
	* Fix __init__.py typo that hid mechanize.seek_wrapped_response and
	  mechanize.str2time.  Fixes
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=465206
	* Fix an obvious bug with experimental firefox 3 cookiejar support.
	  It's still experimental and not properly tested.
	* Change documentation to not require a .port attribute on request
	  objects, since that's unused.
	* Doc fixes
	* Added mechanize.urljoin (RFC 3986 compliant function for joining
	  a base URI with a URI reference)
	* Merge of ClientForm (see above).
	* Moved to git (from SVN) http://github.com/jjlee/mechanize
	* Created an issue tracker http://github.com/jjlee/mechanize/issues
	* Docs are now in markdown format (thanks John Gabriele).
	* Website rearranged.  The old website has been archived at
	  http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/old/ .  The new website is
	  essentially just the mechanize pages, rearranged and cleaned up a
	  bit.
	* Source code rearranged for easier merging with upstream urllib2
	* Fully automated release process.
	* New test runner.  Single test suite; tests create their own HTTP
	  server fixtures (server fixtures are cached where possible for
	  speed).

2009-02-07 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.11 release.
	* Fix quadratic performance in number of .read() calls (and add an
	  automated performance test).

2008-12-03 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.10 release.
	* Add support for Python 2.6: Raise URLError on file: URL errors,
	  not IOError (port of upstream urllib2 fix).  Add support for
	  Python 2.6's per-connection timeouts: Add timeout arguments to
	  urlopen(), Request constructor, .open(), and .open_novisit().
	* Drop support for Python 2.3
	* Add Content-length header to Request object (httplib bug that
	  prevented doing that was fixed in Python 2.4).  There's no
	  change is what is actually sent over the wire here, just in what
	  headers get added to the Request object.
	* Fix AttributeError on .retrieve() with a Request (as opposed to
	  URL string) argument
	* Don't change CookieJar state in .make_cookies().
	* Fix AttributeError in case where .make_cookies() or
	  .cookies_for_request() is called before other methods like
	  .extract_cookies() or .make_cookie_header()
	* Fixes affecting version cookie-attribute
	  (http://bugs.python.org/issue3924).
	* Silence module logging's "no handlers could be found for logger
	  mechanize" warning in a way that doesn't clobber attempts to set
	  log level sometimes
	* Don't use private attribute of request in request upgrade
	  handler (what was I thinking??)
	* Don't call setup() on import of setup.py
	* Add new public function effective_request_host
	* Add .get_policy() method to CookieJar
	* Add method CookieJar.cookies_for_request()
	* Fix documented interface required of requests and responses (and
	  add some tests for this!)
	* Allow either .is_unverifiable() or .unverifiable on request
	  objects (preferring the former)
	* Note that there's a new functional test for digest auth, which
	  fails when run against the sourceforge site (which is the 
	  default).  It looks like this reflects the fact that digest auth
	  has been fairly broken since it was introduced in urllib2.  I
	  don't plan to fix this myself.

2008-09-24 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.9 release.
	* Fix ImportError if sqlite3 not available
	* Fix a couple of functional tests not to wait 5 seconds each

2008-09-13 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.8 release.
	* Close sockets.  This only affects Python 2.5 (and later) -
	  earlier versions of Python were unaffected.  See
	  http://bugs.python.org/issue1627441
	* Make title parsing follow Firefox behaviour wrt child
	  elements (previously the behaviour differed between Factory and
	  RobustFactory).
	* Fix BeautifulSoup RobustLinksFactory (hence RobustFactory) link
	  text parsing for case of link text containing tags (Titus Brown)
	* Fix issue where more tags after <title> caused default parser to
	  raise an exception
	* Handle missing cookie max-age value.  Previously, a warning was
	  emitted in this case.
	* Fix thoroughly broken digest auth (still need functional
	  test!) (trebor74hr@...)
	* Handle cookies containing embedded tabs in mozilla format files
	* Remove an assertion about mozilla format cookies file
	  contents (raise LoadError instead)
	* Fix MechanizeRobotFileParser.set_opener()
	* Fix selection of global form using .select_form() (Titus Brown)
	* Log skipped Refreshes
	* Stop tests from clobbering files that happen to be lying around
	  in cwd (!)
	* Use SO_REUSEADDR for local test server.
	* Raise exception if local test server fails to start.
	* Tests no longer (accidentally) depend on third-party coverage
	  module
	* The usual docs and test fixes.
	* Add convenience method Browser.open_local_file(filename)
	* Add experimental support for Firefox 3 cookie jars
	  ("cookies.sqlite").  Requires Python 2.5
	* Fix a _gzip.py NameError (gzip support is experimental)

2007-05-31 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.7b release.
	* Sub-requests should not usually be visiting, so make it so.  In
	  fact the visible behaviour wasn't really broken here, since
	  .back() skips over None responses (which is odd in itself, but
	  won't be changed until after stable release is branched).
	  However, this patch does change visible behaviour in that it
	  creates new Request objects for sub-requests (e.g. basic auth
	  retries) where previously we just mutated the existing Request
	  object.
	* Changes to sort out abuse of by SeekableProcessor and
	  ResponseUpgradeProcessor (latter shouldn't have been public in
	  the first place) and resulting confusing / unclear / broken
	  behaviour.  Deprecate SeekableProcessor and
	  ResponseUpgradeProcessor.  Add SeekableResponseOpener.  Remove
	  SeekableProcessor and ResponseUpgradeProcessor from Browser.
	  Move UserAgentBase.add_referer_header() to Browser (it was on by
	  default, breaking UserAgent, and should never really have been
	  there).
	* Fix HTTP proxy support: r29110 meant that Request.get_selector()
	  didn't take into account the change to .__r_host
	  (Thanks tgates@...).
	* Redirected robots.txt fetch no longer results in another
	  attempted robots.txt fetch to check the redirection is allowed!
	* Fix exception raised by RFC 3986 implementation with
	  urljoin(base, '/..')
	* Fix two multiple-response-wrapping bugs.
	* Add missing import in tests (caused failure on Windows).
	* Set svn:eol-style to native for all text files in SVN.
	* Add some tests for upgrade_response().
	* Add a functional test for 302 + 404 case.
	* Add an -l option to run the functional tests against a local
	  twisted.web2-based server (you need Twisted installed for this
	  to work).  This is much faster than running against
	  wwwsearch.sourceforge.net
	* Add -u switch to skip unittests (and only run the doctests).

2007-01-07 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>

	* 0.1.6b release
	* Add mechanize.ParseError class, document it as part of the
	  mechanize.Factory interface, and raise it from all Factory
	  implementations.  This is backwards-compatible, since the new
	  exception derives from the old exceptions.
	* Bug fix: Truncation when there is no full .read() before
	  navigating to the next page, and an old response is read after
	  navigation.  This happened e.g. with r = br.open();
	  r.readline(); br.open(url); r.read(); br.back() .
	* Bug fix: when .back() caused a reload, it was returning the old
	  response, not the .reload()ed one.
	* Bug fix: .back() was not returning a copy of the response, which
	  presumably would cause seek position problems.
	* Bug fix: base tag without href attribute would override document
	  URL with a None value, causing a crash (thanks Nathan Eror).
	* Fix .set_response() to close current response first.
	* Fix non-idempotent behaviour of Factory.forms() / .links() .
	  Previously, if for example you got a ParseError during execution
	  of .forms(), you could call it again and have it not raise an
	  exception, because it started out where it left off!
	* Add a missing copy.copy() to RobustFactory .
	* Fix redirection to 'URIs' that contain characters that are not
	  allowed in URIs (thanks Riko Wichmann).  Also, Request
	  constructor now logs a module logging warning about any such bad
	  URIs.
	* Add .global_form() method to Browser to support form controls
	  whose HTML elements are not descendants of any FORM element.
	* Add a new method .visit_response() .  This creates a new history
	  entry from a response object, rather than just changing the
	  current visited response.  This is useful e.g. when you want to
	  use Browser features in a handler.
	* Misc minor bug fixes.

2006-10-25 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>

	* 0.1.5b release: Update setuptools dependencies to depend on
	  ClientForm>=0.2.5 (for an important bug fix affecting fragments
	  in URLs).  There are no other changes in this release -- this
	  release was done purely so that people upgrading to the latest
	  version of mechanize will get the latest ClientForm too.

2006-10-14 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.4b release: (skipped a version deliberately for obscure
	  reasons)
	* Improved auth & proxies support.
	* Follow RFC 3986.
	* Add a .set_cookie() method to Browser .
	* Add Browser.open_novisit() and Request.visit to allow fetching
	  files without affecting Browser state.
	* UserAgent and Browser are now subclasses of UserAgentBase.
	  UserAgent's only role in life above what UserAgentBase does is
	  to provide the .set_seekable_responses() method (it lives there
	  because Browser depends on seekable responses, because that's
	  how browser history is implemented).
	* Bundle BeautifulSoup 2.1.1.  No more dependency pain!  Note that
	  BeautifulSoup is, and always was, optional, and that mechanize
	  will eventually switch to BeautifulSoup version 3, at which
	  point it may well stop bundling BeautifulSoup.  Note also that
	  the module is only used internally, and is not available as a
	  public attribute of the package.  If you dare, you can import it
	  ("from mechanize import _beautifulsoup"), but beware that it
	  will go away later, and that the API of BeautifulSoup will
	  change when the upgrade to 3 happens.  Also, BeautifulSoup
	  support (mainly RobustFactory) is still a little experimental
	  and buggy.
	* Fix HTTP-EQUIV with no content attribute case (thanks Pratik
	  Dam).
	* Fix bug with quoted META Refresh URL (thanks Nilton Volpato).
	* Fix crash with </base> tag (yajdbgr02@...).
	* Somebody found a server that (incorrectly) depends on HTTP
	  header case, so follow the Title-Case convention.  Note that the
	  Request headers interface(s), which were (somewhat oddly -- this
	  is an inheritance from urllib2 that should really be fixed in a
	  better way than it is currently) always case-sensitive still
	  are; the only thing that changed is what actually eventually
	  gets sent over the wire.
	* Use mechanize (not urllib) to open robots.txt.  Don't consult
	  RobotFileParser instance about non-HTTP URLs.
	* Fix OpenerDirector.retrieve(), which was very broken (thanks
	  Duncan Booth).
	* Crash in a much more obvious way if trying to use OpenerDirector
	  after .close() .
	* .reload() on .back() if necessary (necessary iff response was
	  not fully .read() on first .open()ing ) * Strip fragments before
	  retrieving URLs (fixed Request.get_selector() to strip fragment)
	* Fix catching HTTPError subclasses while still preserving all
	  their response behaviour
	* Correct over-enthusiastic documented guarantees of
	  closeable_response .
	* Fix assumption that httplib.HTTPMessage treats dict-style
	  __setitem__ as append rather than set (where on earth did I get
	  that from?).
	* Expose History in mechanize/__init__.py (though interface is
	  still experimental).
	* Lots of other "internals" bugs fixed (thanks to reports /
	  patches from Benji York especially, also Titus Brown, Duncan
	  Booth, and me ;-), where I'm not 100% sure exactly when they
	  were introduced, so not listing them here in detail.
	* Numerous other minor fixes.
	* Some code cleanup.

2006-05-21 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.2b release:
	* mechanize now exports the whole urllib2 interface.
	* Pull in bugfixed auth/proxy support code from Python 2.5.
	* Bugfix: strip leading and trailing whitespace from link URLs
	* Fix .any_response() / .any_request() methods to have ordering.
	  consistent with rest of handlers rather than coming before all
	  of them.
	* Tell cookie-handling code about new TLDs.
	* Remove Browser.set_seekable_responses() (they always are
	  anyway).
	* Show in web page examples how to munge responses and how to do
	  proxy/auth.
	* Rename 0.1.* changes document 0.1.0-changes.txt -->
	  0.1-changes.txt.
	* In 0.1 changes document, note change of logger name from
	  "ClientCookie" to "mechanize"
	* Add something about response objects to changes document
	* Improve Browser.__str__
	* Accept regexp strings as well as regexp objects when finding
	  links.
	* Add crappy gzip transfer encoding support.  This is off by
	  default and warns if you turn it on (hopefully will get better
	  later :-).
	* A bit of internal cleanup following merge with pullparser /
	  ClientCookie.

2006-05-06 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.1a release:
	* Merge ClientCookie and pullparser with mechanize.
	* Response object fixes.
	* Remove accidental dependency on BeautifulSoup introduced in
	  0.1.0a (the BeautifulSoup support is still here, but
	  BeautifulSoup is not required to use mechanize).

2006-05-03 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1.0a release:
	* Stop trying to record precise dates in changelog, since that's
	  silly ;-)
	* A fair number of interface changes: see 0.1.0-changes.txt.
	* Depend on recent ClientCookie with copy.copy()able response
	  objects.
	* Don't do broken XHTML handling by default (need to review code
	  before switching this back on, e.g. should use a real XML parser
	  for first-try at parsing).  To get the old behaviour, pass
	  i_want_broken_xhtml_support=True to mechanize.DefaultFactory /
	  .RobustFactory constructor.
	* Numerous small bug fixes.
	* Documentation & setup.py fixes.
	* Don't use cookielib, to avoid having to work around Python 2.4
	  RFC 2109 bug, and to avoid my braindead thread synchronisation
	  code in cookielib :-((((( (I haven't encountered specific
	  breakage due to latter, but since it's braindead I may as well
	  avoid it).

2005-11-30 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fixed setuptools support.
	* Release 0.0.11a.

2005-11-19 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Release 0.0.10a.

2005-11-17 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fix set_handle_referer.

2005-11-12 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fix history (Gary Poster).
	* Close responses on reload (Gary Poster).
	* Don't depend on SSL support (Gary Poster).

2005-10-31 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Add setuptools support.

2005-10-30 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Don't mask AttributeError exception messages from ClientForm.
	* Document intent of .links() vs. .get_links_iter(); Rename
	  LinksFactory method.
	* Remove pullparser import dependency.
	* Remove Browser.urltags (now an argument to LinksFactory).
	* Document Browser constructor as taking keyword args only (and
	  change positional arg spec).
	* Cleanup of lazy parsing (may fix bugs, not sure...).

2005-10-28 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Support ClientForm backwards_compat switch.

2005-08-28 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Apply optimisation patch (Stephan Richter).

2005-08-15 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Close responses (ie. close the file handles but leave response
	  still .read()able &c., thanks to the response objects we're
	  using) (aurel@nexedi.com).

2005-08-14 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Add missing argument to UserAgent's _add_referer_header stub.
	* Doc and comment improvements.

2005-06-28 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Allow specifying parser class for equiv handling.
	* Ensure correct default constructor args are passed to
	  HTTPRefererProcessor.
	* Allow configuring details of Refresh handling.
	* Switch to tolerant parser.

2005-06-11 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Do .seek(0) after link parsing in a finally block.
	* Regard text/xhtml as HTML.
	* Fix 2.4-compatibility bugs.
	* Fix spelling of '_equiv' feature string.

2005-05-30 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Turn on Referer, Refresh and HTTP-Equiv handling by default.

2005-05-08 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fix .reload() to not update history (thanks to Titus Brown).
	* Use cookielib where available

2005-03-01 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fix referer bugs: Don't send URL fragments; Don't add in Referer
	  header in redirected request unless original request had a
	  Referer header.

2005-02-19 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
        * Allow supplying own mechanize.FormsFactory, so eg. can use
          ClientForm.XHTMLFormParser.  Also allow supplying own Request
          class, and use sensible defaults for this.  Now depends on
          ClientForm 0.1.17.  Side effect is that, since we use the
          correct Request class by default, there's (I hope) no need for
          using RequestUpgradeProcessor in Browser._add_referer_header()
          :-)

2005-01-30 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Released 0.0.9a.

2005-01-05 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fix examples (scraped sites have changed).
	* Fix .set_*() method boolean arguments.
	* The .response attribute is now a method, .response()
	* Don't depend on BaseProcessor (no longer exists).

2004-05-18 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Released 0.0.8a:
	* Added robots.txt observance, controlled by
	* BASE element has attribute 'href', not 'uri'! (patch from Jochen
	  Knuth)
	* Fixed several bugs in handling of Referer header.
	* Link.__eq__ now returns False instead of raising AttributeError
	  on comparison with non-Link (patch from Jim Jewett)
	* Removed dependencies on HTTPS support in Python and on
	  ClientCookie.HTTPRobotRulesProcessor

2004-01-18 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Added robots.txt observance, controlled by
	  UserAgent.set_handle_robots().  This is now on by default.
	* Removed set_persistent_headers() method -- just use .addheaders,
	  as in base class.

2004-01-09 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Removed unnecessary dependence on SSL support in Python.  Thanks
	  to Krzysztof Kowalczyk for bug report.
	* Released 0.0.7a.

2004-01-06 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Link instances may now be passed to .click_link() and
	  .follow_link().
	* Added a new example program, pypi.py.

2004-01-05 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Released 0.0.5a.
	* If <title> tag was missing, links and forms would not be parsed.
	  Also, base element (giving base URI) was ignored.  Now parse
	  title lazily, and get base URI while parsing links.  Also, fixed
	  ClientForm to take note of base element.  Thanks to Phillip J.
	  Eby for bug report.
	* Released 0.0.6a.

2004-01-04 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Fixed _useragent._replace_handler() to update self.handlers
	  correctly.
	* Updated required pullparser version check.
	* Visiting a URL now deselects form (sets self.form to None).
	* Only first Content-Type header is now checked by
	  ._viewing_html(), if there are more than one.
	* Stopped using getheaders from ClientCookie -- don't need it,
	  since depend on Python 2.2, which has .getheaders() method on
	  responses.  Improved comments.
	* .open() now resets .response to None.  Also rearranged .open() a
	  bit so instance remains in consistent state on failure.
	* .geturl() now checks for non-None .response, and raises Browser.
	* .back() now checks for non-None .response, and doesn't attempt
	  to parse if it's None.
	* .reload() no longer adds new history item.
	* Documented tag argument to .find_link().
	* Fixed a few places where non-keyword arguments for .find_link()
	  were silently ignored.  Now raises ValueError.

2004-01-02 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Use response_seek_wrapper instead of seek_wrapper, which broke
	  use of reponses after they're closed.
	* (Fixed response_seek_wrapper in ClientCookie.)
	* Fixed adding of Referer header.  Thanks to Per Cederqvist for
	  bug report.
	* Released 0.0.4a.
	* Updated required ClientCookie version check.

2003-12-30 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Added support for character encodings (for matching link text).
	* Released 0.0.3a.

2003-12-28 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Attribute lookups are no longer forwarded to .response --
	  you have to do it explicitly.
	* Added .geturl() method, which just delegates to .response.
	* Big rehash of UserAgent, which was broken.  Added a test.
	* Discovered that zip() doesn't raise an exception when its
	  arguments are of different length, so several tests could pass
	  when they should have failed.  Fixed.
	* Fixed <A/> case in ._parse_html().
	* Released 0.0.2a.

2003-12-27 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Added and improved docstrings.
	* Browser.form is now a public attribute.  Also documented
	  Browser's public attributes.
	* Added base_url and absolute_url attributes to Link.
	* Tidied up .open().  Relative URL Request objects are no longer
	  converted to absolute URLs -- they should probably be absolute
	  in the first place anyway.
	* Added proper Referer handling (the handler in ClientCookie is a
	  hack that only covers a restricted case).
	* Added click_link method, for symmetry with .click() / .submit()
	  methods (which latter apply to forms).  Of these methods,
	  .click/.click_link() returns a request, and .submit/
	  .follow_link() actually .open()s the request.
	* Updated broken example code.

2003-12-24 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Modified setup.py so can easily register with PyPI.

2003-12-22 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* Released 0.0.1a.
